		<h1> BIG BROTHER<sup><sup>BETA</sup></sup> </h1>
		<h2> We're Watching Over You! </h2>
		
		<br> <br>
		
		<h2> Terms of Service </h2>
		
		<br>
		
		<p> To be able to sign up for the service, you must accept the following terms and conditions. </p>
		
		<p> <i>
			By using this service, you agree <br> <br>
			1. To share location-based sensitive data with the application's communication servers, in order to provide a seamless experience across all devices; <br>
			2. To provide compulsory feedback about the application at the end of the Beta testing period of the application, if any; <br>
			3. That you may be asked for personal information through the app, which may be similar but not limited to your date of birth, your full name and address, and your profession, to which you hereby consent; <br>
			4. To allow the creators of the application to have a little bit of fun with the funds generated from operation of the application, by throwing parties organizing similar social gatherings; <br>
			5. That psychological biases plague us all, and that they ought to be eradicated, but cannot be removed entirely since that would imply trying to undo millennia of biological evolution; <br>
			6. To try and make sure you switch off fans and lights and similar electrical appliances when not at use, at home and at school; <br>
			7. To strive to include rice in your meals for at least five days per week; <br>						
			8. That Shah Rukh Khan might be a little overrated as a Bollywood actor;<br>
			9. To strive to protect your privacy and the privacy of others around you, as long as your actions do not infringe upon the fundamental rights of others, and/or your actions do not disrupt the execution of government orders; <br>
			10. That a good sense of humour is important in a person; <br>
			11. That schools and similar private and public institutions ought to reflect upon statement 10; <br>
			12. That the author of this body of text claims no responsibility of the validity of claims regarding the application and the service it provides on this website; <br>
			13. To try and encourage the concept of "Web literacy" and what is stands for, and recognize the importance of information technology in the growth of the country and/or nation; <br>
			14. That academics aren't what schools are all about, and that schools should aim to promote all-round development in enrolled students, as well as staff members; <br>
			15. That we just might be doomed as citizens of the nation, and that the future might not be bright as we think; <br>
			16. That statement 15 is unnecessarily pessimistic, and that there is much hope for the future ahead of us; <br>
			17. That both statements 15 and 16 take extreme stances on what to expect from the future, and that it would be much better to wait and see how it unfolds; <br>
			18. That statements 15 and 16 and 17 are useless in this context, and ought to be removed from this list of statements; <br>
			19. That the author of this "legal" document knows little about Indian Law, and is trying to waste time into having you believe this wall of text holds at least some significance, when it really doesn't, except for a couple of lines that may (and will) be used to the application's creators' advantage; <br>
			21. That you failed to see the author never wrote statement 20; <br>
			22. To eradicate the overused joke referenced to by statement 21, and to strive to not spread it over applications of social media that include Facebook and WhatsApp;  <br>
			23. That your actions on this website may be recorded by an external camera or screen capture software, including the entering of sensitive information into the forms (or similar Web elements) on the website; <br>
			24. To try and read Terms of Service documents more carefully in the future; <br>
			25. To click on "I Agree" already, since legal paperwork is such a waste of time; <br>
			26. That the author really wants to talk about the meaning of life, but would rather not, since many statements have been dedicated to the same in the past, and within this body of text, and it would therefore be somewhat redundant to sit down and discuss the topic at great length, and that in the end, nobody cares, keeping in mind that there might be too many commas for one man to digest in this statement; <br>
			27. That the creators of the application claim no responsibility for any damage or miscommunication caused through the application, and that the liability lies with the operator of the application; <br>
			28. That the application being discussed, at the time of writing this body of text, belongs in the public domain, even if it does not exist at all; <br>
			29. To learn some HTML and CSS and try to make webpages on your own next time; <br>
			30. That the cake is a lie (and that the author is quite certain this reference, though quite popular internationally, is going to not be understood by many readers of this body of text that belong to the target audience of the application being discusssed); <br>
			31. That it's quite nice we've finally arrived at the end of all the legalities you're going to have to go through to sign up and finally get started with what you're here for. <br>
