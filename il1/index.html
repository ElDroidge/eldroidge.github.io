<h1>This is Il1</h1>

	<p>Ok, keep in mind that these are all open source fonts, so they’re the ones that are freely available on Google Fonts. Otherwise it’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack if you’re also looking for licensed fonts.</p>

	<p>So to begin with, there are some sans-serif fonts, like Advent Pro, Andika, Convergence, Exo, and Geo, that take too many liberties in my opinion, so I don’t like them because I can’t take them seriously lol.</p>

<h2>Sans-Serif Options:</h2>

<h3>ABeeZee</h3>
	<p>The taller x-height, round letterform and fanciful details makes it a font with character, perhaps too much so if it’s not a headline.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Allerta</h3>
	<p>Curved terminal for lowercase ‘L’</p>

<hr>

<h3>Anaheim</h3>
	<p>Reminds me of a monospace but I don’t think it is one. Great differentiation between capital ‘I’, lowercase ‘L’ and the numeral ‘1’.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Antic</h3> 
	<p>This one is alright… I don’t like the variability of line thickness for how lightweight it already is.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Basic and Cabin</h3>
	<p>They curve the terminals at the end of the lowercase ‘L’ and make it taller than the uppercase ‘I’, Cabin does it better in my opinion.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Carrois Gothic</h3> 
	<p>Takes an interesting approach and differentiates the lowercase ‘L’ at the top of the letter (ascender) instead of at the bottom terminal</p>

<hr>

<h3>Chivo and Didactic</h3>
	<p>This one’s great, the uppercase ‘I’ is given a slab, and the lowercase ‘L’ is left alone. Also, the 1 is nicely differentiated, looks very recognizably like a number. Didactic is similar in this regard, but more geometric in comparison.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Duru</h3>
	<p>A good option but only 1 style available, so not much you can do with it in terms of formatting.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Lekton</h3>
	<p>Aan interesting one, reminds me of a monospace font but is actually just sans apparently. Not a fan of the lowercase ‘r’.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Metrophobic</h3>
	<p>Another interesting one, the uppercase ‘I’ is given slabs, and the lowercase ‘L’ is left alone… It’s interesting how square it looks despite the roundness, like if you look at the lowercase ‘o’, it looks like a square inside an ellipse.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Monda</h3>
	<p>An interesting one because they went all out lol. The uppercase ‘I’ has slabs, the lowercase ‘L’ has a curved terminal, and the 1 is very much differentiated between the two.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Mobile</h3>
	<p>This one is… alright. The uppercase ‘I’ has a slab, the lowercase ‘L’ is left alone, and I don’t know what the fuck is going on with the height of their numerals…</p>

<hr>

<h3>Noto Sans</h3>
	<p>I happen to like this one upon first sight, I’d never heard of it before but I think I’m going to give it a shot.</p>

<hr>

<h3>Raleway</h3>
	<p>Geometric with a twist.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Monospace Options</h2>

<h3>Anonymous Pro</h3>
	<p>Surprisingly approachable despite being a mono font</p>

<hr>

<h3>PT Mono</h3>
	<p>Very intriguing monospace font, but as a web font the kerning bothers me, especially whatever’s going on with letter’s next to lowercase ‘L’s.</p>
