    <h1> Droicman: User Manual </h1>
    <p> <i> Last update: v0.0.15 </i> </p> 
    <br>
    <p align = "justify"> Droicman is an arcade-style game based on arcade classics like Pac-Man. The objective of the game is simple: eat as many pellets as possible, dodge enemies, eat the enemies when you have the power, and try and get as far as possible. The game currently has only four actual levels, but many more will be added soon. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> The Basics </h2>
    <p align = "justify"> The yellow object that can be moved by the in-game buttons will be referred to as Droicman from here onward, and is the player object of the game. The small pink objects are tiny pellets, worth 50 points each. The large pink objects are large pellets worth 100 points each, and award invincibility to the player upon consumption. The red objects that look like Droicman are in fact enemies, and will end the game upon collision with Droicman. The only way to defeat them is by gaining invincibility and eating them up, in which case they are worth 200 points each. </p>
    <p align = "justify"> Your final score will depend on the points you collected before dying, and the time you lasted for (in seconds). The time taken will be subtracted from the collected points to yield the final score, making every second precious. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> The HUD </h2>
    <p> The HUD consists of three numbers, each displayed at the top of the screen: the level number, the points collected, and the time elapsed, respectively. The first level (Level 0) will always be without any enemies, and will serve as a way to collect some guaranteed points, and get used to the controls for another game. </p>
    <br>
    <h2> Controls </h2>
    <p align = "justify"> The buttons in-game can be used as either a D-pad or a joystick. To use the buttons as a D-pad, simply tap (and at times, hold) the button corresponding to the direction Droicman is to go in. To use them as a joystick, slide your finger over the buttons, treating your finger position as the position of the analog stick. </p>
    <p align = "justify"> Droicman cannot turn to a direction if it is being blocked by a wall; if Droicman is to turn left at a certain point but cannot travel in that direction due to the presence of a wall, it won't turn left to begin with. </p>
    <p align = "justify"> You might notice that Droicman does not switch directions at times even when it has the room to, especially when the directions are being switched between left/right and up/down. That is (most probably) not a bug, and the game is not being unresponsive. It is simply a matter of great timing to be able to turn and go into such spaces at the tap of a button; I can't do it either. That is why the game features mechanics that allow the direction Droicman is to go into to be decided before the actual changing of direction. Simply tap and hold the corresponding direction key (or hold your finger over it) to turn to that direction as soon as Droicman finds room to. So for instance, if Droicman is just about to come to a point where it can either turn left or right, start holding the left or right direction key before that point is reached, to turn to that direction as soon as Droicman reaches that point. </p>
